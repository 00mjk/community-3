# Tekton Governance

The Tekton project was donated to the [CDF](cd.foundation) in March 2019.
Establishing governance is still a work in progress and for now, Tekton is
overseen by the Knative Build WG.

## Procedures

### Creating a new repository

New repositories can be created in the `tektoncd` Github organization with approval from two
maintainers (for now these can be found in [Github](https://github.com/orgs/tektoncd/teams/maintainers/members).

Approval should be requested and captured in an issue in this repo.
